# Config templates

We have here TT files that may generate configuration files for:

* [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org) in various circumstances
* [nginx](http://nginx.org)
* Many [Logstash](http://logstash.net) inputs, outputs and filters.
* [PerfSONAR](http://perfsonar.net)
* Some basic udev rules
* named

And a tiny Perl script that fills them from a JSON file, if it has the
correct structure.
